1) Add some try-catch in the class signal
2) Correct the inverse fourier transform/ matlab and calculate by hand
3) readme
4) Fourier filter
5) median filter
6) See where to optimize the code (beautiful code)
7) Need to check why the histogram doesn't give the right amplitude of the signal.
8) Need to check the histogram error handler to see if it is correct (we need to see the message).
