### Sound processing
<p>This project deals with the treatment of sound</p>
<p> Our reading of the audio file relies on the Audiofile class developed by Adam Stark:
  https://github.com/adamstark/AudioFile </p>
1. Computation of intensity histograms</p>
2. Implementation of the discrete Fourier transform (1D/2D) and its inverse</p>
3. Noise removal using several filtering options</p>
4. Filtering sound in frequence or time space</p>
